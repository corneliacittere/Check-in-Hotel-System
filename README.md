A Check in Hotel System created in Python using object oriented programming.
Guests can:
•	See available rooms in the Hotel.
•	Choose a room type: single (40$), double (70$), twin (60$).
•	Discount 15% if a total price is bigger than 500 $.
The Hotel can:
•	Issues a bill when guest check out.
•	Display available rooms.
•	Take request on rom type basis by verifying rooms availability.
For simplicity we assume that any guest can book any amount of rooms (but less that the amount of available rooms) and only of one type.
